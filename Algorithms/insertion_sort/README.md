## Synopsis

HW of Algorithms course at NCKUEE.
Use C or C++ to implement an insertion sorting algorithm that accepts an input file with the first line indicating the number of keys to be sorted, followed by the list of keys with one line for each key. The algorithm should generate an output file with the number of keys sorted in the first line, followed by the sorted keys with one key in each line.

## Methods
Using fsteeam to read file from .txt to double vector. Then us insertion_sort function to finish.
